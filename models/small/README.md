# Depth Anything V2 Small – Transformers Version

Depth Anything V2 is trained from 595K synthetic labeled images and 62M+ real unlabeled images, providing the most capable monocular depth estimation (MDE) model with the following features:
- more fine-grained details than Depth Anything V1
- more robust than Depth Anything V1 and SD-based models (e.g., Marigold, Geowizard)
- more efficient (10x faster) and more lightweight than SD-based models
- impressive fine-tuned performance with our pre-trained models

This model checkpoint is compatible with the transformers library.

Depth Anything V2 was introduced in [the paper of the same name](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09414) by Lihe Yang et al. It uses the same architecture as the original Depth Anything release, but uses synthetic data and a larger capacity teacher model to achieve much finer and robust depth predictions. The original Depth Anything model was introduced in the paper [Depth Anything: Unleashing the Power of Large-Scale Unlabeled Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10891) by Lihe Yang et al., and was first released in [this repository](https://github.com/LiheYoung/Depth-Anything).

[Online demo](https://huggingface.co/spaces/depth-anything/Depth-Anything-V2).

## Model description

Depth Anything V2 leverages the [DPT](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/dpt) architecture with a [DINOv2](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/dinov2) backbone.

The model is trained on ~600K synthetic labeled images and ~62 million real unlabeled images, obtaining state-of-the-art results for both relative and absolute depth estimation.

## Intended uses & limitations

You can use the raw model for tasks like zero-shot depth estimation. See the [model hub](https://huggingface.co/models?search=depth-anything) to look for
other versions on a task that interests you.

### How to use

Here is how to use this model to perform zero-shot depth estimation:

```python
from transformers import pipeline
from PIL import Image
import requests

# load pipe
pipe = pipeline(task="depth-estimation", model="depth-anything/Depth-Anything-V2-Small-hf")

# load image
url = 'http://images.cocodataset.org/val2017/000000039769.jpg'
image = Image.open(requests.get(url, stream=True).raw)

# inference
depth = pipe(image)["depth"]
```

Alternatively, you can use the model and processor classes:

```python
from transformers import AutoImageProcessor, AutoModelForDepthEstimation
import torch
import numpy as np
from PIL import Image
import requests

url = "http://images.cocodataset.org/val2017/000000039769.jpg"
image = Image.open(requests.get(url, stream=True).raw)

image_processor = AutoImageProcessor.from_pretrained("depth-anything/Depth-Anything-V2-Small-hf")
model = AutoModelForDepthEstimation.from_pretrained("depth-anything/Depth-Anything-V2-Small-hf")

# prepare image for the model
inputs = image_processor(images=image, return_tensors="pt")

with torch.no_grad():
    outputs = model(**inputs)
    predicted_depth = outputs.predicted_depth

# interpolate to original size
prediction = torch.nn.functional.interpolate(
    predicted_depth.unsqueeze(1),
    size=image.size[::-1],
    mode="bicubic",
    align_corners=False,
)
```
